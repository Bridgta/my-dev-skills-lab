# My Developer Skills Lab

## Introduction

This lab provides an opportunity to practice working with jQuery.

This lab **is a deliverable**.

### Requirements

1. Add HTML and CSS as necessary to implement an application that looks close to this wireframe:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k06ZMEN.png">
	
2. Code the following _user stories_, using jQuery where possible:

	- As a User (AAU), I don't want to see any developer skills in the list so that I can start with a fresh slate.

	- AAU, I want to be able to type in a skill and have it added to my list of skills by clicking a button.

	- AAU, I want to be able to remove an individual skill one at a time in case I make a mistake.

## Bonus

##### Replace the first user story above with the following story:

- AAU, I want to see my previous list of developer skills so that I can start from where I last left off.

##### Hint:

- Research [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) as a way to persist (remember) the developer skills each time they are updated.
